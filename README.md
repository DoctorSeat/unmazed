# unmazed

A smart, easy and reliable solution for indoor navigation.

For more information please visit [unmazed.de](https://unmazed.de). 
This project is still under very active development and a lot is subject to change.
 ## Getting started

To get started, simply run main.dart. You will be prompted to enter start and end points. 
As of right now all the corresponding routes are only saved locally, so it is not yet 
possible to try this at home.
Stay tuned for future updates!
